! Impose any external measured flows by
! identifying the node with NodeType =  3 – STREAM (whose ID is NODE-ID) at which the flow was measured, 
! noting the ratio of measured to modelled flow at this node, and then
! applying that ratio to Runoff and Baseflow rates for this timestep in any
! drainage which is upstream of this node (including the drainage the node lies in)

!this is different to the previous method i proposed, which just fiddled
!the flow from the measuredflownode to this node until the total inflow to
!this node was as measured
! I changed methods so that we could get the runoff from all catchments set
! properly, because the water quality folks need runoff&baseflow from ALL drainages
